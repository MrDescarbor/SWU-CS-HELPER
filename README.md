# Southwest University Computer Science and Technology Cooperative Program Mutual Aid Repository

## Foreword

A few days ago, I accidentally deleted a portion of these materials. I feel regretful and reluctant, and at the same time, I suddenly realized that I haven't looked at them for a long time. I began to wonder if they still have any value remaining.

For backup purposes, and since the value of things should not be judged by one individual, I believe they deserve a repository—an open repository.

I hope they can shed a little light on your journey.

## 前言

数天前失手删除了这些资料的一部分。惋惜，不舍，同时突然意识到自己已经很久没有看过他们了。我便开始思考他们是否还有留存的价值。
出于备份的目的，以及事物的价值让一个个体来评判不合适，我认为他们值得一个仓库，一个公开的仓库。

希望他们能稍微照亮你的路。
